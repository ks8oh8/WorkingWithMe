## Background

I have spent a lot of years in tech, having started my career in IT as a sysadmin back in the days when we needed a 12x12 room to house the iron to run a single, *slow* database. Back then we were doing what I now affectionately refer to as "caveman DevOps," weaving together terrible bash scripts and poorly maintained and rarely identifiable cron jobs to automate away some of the daily toil. 

I eventually got a call from a friend of mine who said - "I've got an interesting opportunity for you!" - and she proceeded to tell me about a startup she was working for that needed an IT guy to get things in place, and then ideally contribute on the software side. 

From there, the rest is sort of history. I went from IT - writing code to support my work, to QA - writing code to support my work, to writing code for feature work, to maintaining infrastructure, and to working on personal projects. 

I've worn many hats from manual testing to developing applications. From working with customers to being a part of the team that pitched and fought to have AppArmor (then Subdomain, a SELinux alternative) included in the Linux Kernel (LKML HELL). I've worked in companies from 2 to 2000 and led everything from QA, to Product, to Engineering, to Support, to Architecture, to Technical Sales, and there's still so much more to learn and grow!

I've been fortunate enough to work at companies like SUSE Linux, Puppet, and CircleCI where I've honed my love of community, open-source software, and designing and building products, tools, and infrastructure that solve problems not just for our customers, but for engineers as well with a focus on repeatability, efficiency, and delivering an amazing user experience.

Finally, I am passionate about helping others. My partner and I owned a Business (Doggy Daycare) together for 10 years here in Portland. During our time there we hired almost exclusively from marginalized communities, established profit sharing with our employees, and worked with folks to help build work experience, provide coaching and mentoring, and build long-term skills that would enable them to grow as leaders and empower them to seek their own successes. 

## Leadership 

Through the course of my work as an IC, I was pushed into leadership roles by the folks around me, some formal, some informal, taking on titles like "team lead" and "tech lead" and so forth, and at some point, I met a fork in the road with my career:

* Option A: Go be a full-time manager and work under an amazing mentor
* Option B: Continue down the tech path in a role working on an amazing open-source project

With the support of my friends, colleagues, and what was to become one of my greatest mentors and leaders, I made the jump into leadership. From there I was rapidly promoted to Director and went from leading local teams in a startup to leading teams across the US in a post-acquisition world where I was leading our efforts to integrate our products and our people. 

Since then I've spent the last ~15 years in Director, Sr. Director, and VP roles in a lot of startups, both large and small, Series A, B, and C for the most part, and have had a ton of great peers, mentors, *opportunities* (read: f-ups), and leaders to learn from along the way. 

I strongly believe in empowering my teams to succeed. This means ensuring that we understand why we're doing the work we're doing, what impact it has for our team, for the org, for the business, and finally providing opportunities for folks to thrive in their roles and grow! 

## Values

### Growth oriented
* As a human, I am always looking for my next challenge, the next opportunity that will teach me something new, that will see me achieve something I have failed at before, or to fail and learn from doing something I loved trying. I love working with similarly oriented people. 

* I am committed to helping folks grow and reach their goals, and I will provide meaningful feedback where I see something notable, right, wrong, or indifferent.

* I love feedback, and I welcome it at *almost* any time.

* I don't mind if we make mistakes. I do mind if we make the same mistake twice. We should always be looking for the lessons when things go wrong, and ensuring that we take that opportunity to learn in hopes of avoiding similar issues down the line. 

### Transparency

* We should work out in the open, as leaders, and as teams. The frequency with which I have seen confusion, communication issues, alignment issues, and otherwise come as a result of a lack of ability to see, and/or understand what a team is doing is *too damn high!* 

* I have a no-surprises policy. If within my purview and rights to share, I will ensure that I communicate any impactful information to you, prior to the moment in which it's too late for action to be taken. 

### Solutions oriented

* It is my goal to bring solutions and mitigation strategies when I bring a problem to the table. Granted, this isn't always possible—sometimes information must flow regardless of how prepared we are.

* I am always down to partner with anyone on a solution, but I deeply appreciate when people show up with ideas or strategies of their own!

### Trust
* But verify. I don't want to micromanage. As such, I will always be clear about what I need, the guardrails, and the desired outcome(s) as well as what information I need to understand that things are on track and healthy.

* I generally believe that everyone is trying to do the best job they can given the information that they have, their ability to action it, and the system that supports them. 

* I want to have a relationship with folks around me wherein we can trust each other to be open, honest, and share the good with the bad. I understand that I have to earn that trust, but ask that we start with a "same team" philosophy!

* Say what you'll do, do what you say. Be accountable. 

### Respect
* We should be direct and clear about what is happening, and what we need - while being kind and fostering recovery in challenging moments. We are here because we are smart, we are talented, so ask questions, tell me how I can help you, and seek to learn from each other where we can!

### Communication
* Start with too much, I'll let you know when to dial it back! 

* I welcome questions, and so too should we all! There are no bad questions, and it's likely that if something isn't clear to you, it may not be clear to others, so please speak up! 

* I welcome being challenged - hell I *expect to be* because I do not have all the answers and I am frequently not the smartest person in a room. 

* I'm a fixer, I'm always going to try to solve a problem. If that's not what you're looking for let me know what you are! Do you want an answer or a solution? Are you escalating? Do you just need to shout for a bit? All good, just set the stage. 

### Empathy
* We should assume that folks are trying to do the best job they can or know how to, and work to understand their challenges with an eye towards supporting future success! 

## Please do
* Be proactive, take initiative, ask for forgiveness.
* Loop me in as soon as you've run into a roadblock/issue/etc - not necessarily so I can solve it, but instead so I am aware.
* Involve me! You have a cool idea? Want to show off something you're working on? Need some help or a rubber duck to chat at? I'm down.

## Please don't
* Think "Because that's the way we've always done it!" is a good reason to do it!
* Start with "That's not my job!". 
* Surprise me if avoidable, and I won't surprise you! (see above!)
* Over polish, or perfect your work, unless we've identified it as necessary. 
* Log off for the night with any stress or anxiety that I can help resolve for you on a call. I am **always** happy to take a call and help provide calm and stability where I am able to. 

## Finally
The Oxford comma rules and a '-' is a valid and helpful literary device. Don't @ me.

## P.S.
Did you read this? What feedback do you have for me? Let's chat!
